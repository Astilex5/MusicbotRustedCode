The Musicbot Rewriten in Rustc

Welcome to this Github for the Progression of MusicBot in RustC.

I welcome anyone who is willing to help progress this project along a many hands make light work.

Just to give cridet where it is due. just-some-bots are the Original Creators of Musicbot (Python).

However I feel Rust is a better pick for a language as it is forward moving and I feel python is to dynamic to allow safe code to run.

If you need a referance point here is the link to just some bots https://github.com/Just-Some-Bots/MusicBot.

We are looking to convert the code not rewrite the darned thing.

FAQs

What is the Lang?
--Rustc
Is it GPL?
--No it is MIT since the last owner did not openly declare GPL or such others.
(This is to create a protective Barrier in case if we cannot support cross-platform.)
Then how can I make my own bot?
As I said. just-some-bots did not declare GPL or MIT so their code is free game. So is my code you can't share my code however.

How can I help?
You can contact me on github via my Email.(My Profile)
