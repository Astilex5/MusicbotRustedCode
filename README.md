# MusicbotRustedCode
The Musicbot Rewriten in Rustc

Welcome to this Github for the Progression of MusicBot in RustC.

I welcome anyone who is willing to help progress this project along as many hands make light work.

Just to give credit where it is due. just-some-bots are the Original Creators of Musicbot (Python).

However I feel Rust is a better pick for a language as it is forward moving and I feel python is too dynamic to allow safe code to run.

If you need a reference point here is the link to just some bots https://github.com/Just-Some-Bots/MusicBot.

We are looking to convert the code not rewrite the darned thing.

FAQs

What is the Lang?
Rustc

Is it GPL?
No. Click the MIT in the Upper righthand corner of my page for the Details.
(This is to create a protective Barrier in case if we cannot support cross-platform.)

Then how can I make my own bot?
Just-some-bots did not declare GPL or MIT so their code is free game. And mine is MIT so... Yeah your fine.

How can I help?
You can contact me on github via my Email.(My Profile) or @Astilexgaming on Twitter
